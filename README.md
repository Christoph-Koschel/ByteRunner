# ByteRunner

ByteRunner is a 64-bit Virtual Machine, similar to JVM, designed for the programming language [Illusion Script](https://github.com/Christoph-Koschel/Illusion-Script) (Currently, the repository is private due to unstable builds).

## Features

- **Stack Based**: ByteRunner uses a stack-based architecture, which allows for efficient memory management and supports various programming constructs.
- **Self-contained**: The main feature of ByteRunner is its self-contained nature, requiring only a small base of native code to run any program on any supported platform.
- **Dynamic loading** (Planned): ByteRunner is capable of loading and executing native DLL/SO files through interrupts.
